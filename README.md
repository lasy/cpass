# The cpass R package

`cpass` is an `R` package for the application of the C-PASS procedure for the diagnosis of PMDD and MRMD.

Before installing `cpass`, make sure that you have the `devtools` package installed by running in your `R` console:

`install.packages("devtools")`


`library(devtools)`

Then install and load the `cpass` package with: 

`devtools::install_github("lasy/cpass", dependencies = TRUE)`


`library(cpass)`

The package vignette, _i.e._ instructions for installing and using the package, can be found here: [https://lasy.github.io/cpass/vignettes/cpass_vignette.html](https://lasy.github.io/cpass/vignettes/cpass_vignette.html).

The description and validation of the C-PASS procedure can be found in [Eisenlohr-Moul, et al., 2016](https://github.com/lasy/cpass/blob/master/references/eisenlohr-moul2016.pdf).
